public void testCase() {
}

📌 testng.xml used for?
 A suite is represented by one XML file called testng.xml by default. It can contain one or more tests and is defined by the <suite> tag.

Code:
package CodingChallengeOf100Days;

import org.testng.Assert;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;

import java.util.Random;

public class TestSample {
 @Test(retryAnalyzer = MyRetry.class)
 public void Test1() {
 System.out.println("Test 1 is executed");
 Assert.assertTrue(1 == 1, "Test 1 failed due to mismatch of condition");
 }

 @Test(retryAnalyzer = MyRetry.class)
 public void Test2() {
 Random random = new Random();
 int x = random.nextInt(50);
 System.out.println("x = " + x);
 System.out.println("Test 2 is executed");
 Assert.assertTrue(4 == x, "Test 2 failed due to mismatch of condition");

// Assert.assertTrue(4 == 5, "Test 2 failed due to mismatch of condition");

 }
