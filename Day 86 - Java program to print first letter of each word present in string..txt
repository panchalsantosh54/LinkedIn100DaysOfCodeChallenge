ðŸ“Œ A String class can be used to represent the character strings, all the string literals in a Java program are implemented as an instance of a String class. 

ðŸ“Œ The Strings are constants and their values cannot be changed (immutable) once created.

ðŸ“Œ Solution:
package CodingChallengeOf100Days;

public class FirstCharacterPrintTest {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 String str = "Where there's smoke, there's fire";
 char ch[] = str.toCharArray();
 System.out.println("The first character of each word: ");
 for (int i = 0; i < ch.length; i++) {
 //logic to implement first character of each word in a string
 if (ch[i] != ' ' && (i == 0 || ch[i - 1] == ' ')) {
 System.out.println(ch[i]);
 }
 }
 }
}
