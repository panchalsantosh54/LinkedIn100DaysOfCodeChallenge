 Java Program to Find Maximum Number of Words in Sentences.

A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.
You are given an array of strings sentences, where each sentences[i] represents a single sentence.
Return the maximum number of words that appear in a single sentence.

ðŸ“Œ Example 1:
Input: sentences = ["alice and bob love leetcode", "i think so too", "this is great thanks very much"]
Output: 6

ðŸ“Œ Explanation: 
- The first sentence, "alice and bob love leetcode", has 5 words in total.
- The second sentence, "i think so too", has 4 words in total.
- The third sentence, "this is great thanks very much", has 6 words in total.
Thus, the maximum number of words in a single sentence comes from the third sentence, which has 6 words.

ðŸ“Œ Constraints:
1 <= sentences.length <= 100
1 <= sentences[i].length <= 100
sentences[i] consists only of lowercase English letters and ' ' only.
sentences[i] does not have leading or trailing spaces.
All the words in sentences[i] are separated by a single space.

ðŸ“Œ Solution:
package CodingChallengeOf100Days;

public class NoOfWordsInSentence {
 public static int countMaxNoOfWords(String[] sentences) {
 int count = 0;
 for (String sentence : sentences) {
 int wordCount = 0;
 System.out.println(sentence);
 String[] strArray = sentence.split(" ");
 for (int i = 0; i < strArray.length; i++) {
 wordCount++;
 }
 count = Math.max(count, wordCount);
 }
 return count;
 }
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 String[] sentences = {"alice and bob love leetcode", "I think so too", "This is great thanks very much"};
 int count = countMaxNoOfWords(sentences);
 System.out.println("Maximum number of words found in a sentence: " +count);
 }
}
