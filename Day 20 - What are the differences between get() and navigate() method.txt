📍 What are the differences between get() and navigate() method?

🔵 get():
✔ get() method is responsible for loading the page and waits until the page has finished loading.
✔ It cannot track the history of the browser.

Example : 
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
driver.get("http://www.google.com");

🔵 navigate():
✔ navigate() is only responsible for redirecting the page and then returning immediately.
✔ It tracks the browser history and can perform back and forth in the browser.

Example: 
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
driver.navigate().to("https://www.amazon.com");

driver.navigate().forward();
driver.navigate().back();
driver.navigate().refresh();
