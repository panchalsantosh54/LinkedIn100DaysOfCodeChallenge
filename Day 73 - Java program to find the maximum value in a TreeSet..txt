ğŸ“Œ The last() method is used to return the last of the element of a TreeSet. 

ğŸ“Œ The last element here is being referred to the highest of the elements in the set. 

ğŸ“Œ If the elements are of integer types, then the largest integer is returned. If the elements are of the string types, then the elements are checked in the alphabetical order and the string starting with the last alphabets in the order of dictionary is returned irrespective of length.

ğŸ“Œ Solution:
package CodingChallengeOf100Days;

import java.util.TreeSet;

public class FindBiggestInTreeSet {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 TreeSet<Integer> numbers = new TreeSet<>();
 numbers.add(5);
 numbers.add(12);
 numbers.add(25);
 numbers.add(8);

 //To find the biggest number, so we use a method called last().
 int biggestNumber = numbers.last();
 System.out.println(biggestNumber);
 }
}
